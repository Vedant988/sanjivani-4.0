Place the provided Onion Harvester Machine image (from the recent conversation attachment) at:

src/assets/projects/onion-harvester.jpg

Then run the dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`) or rebuild the project so the bundler picks up the new image.

If you want me to add the actual image file into the repository, grant permission and I will save it as `onion-harvester.jpg` in this folder.
